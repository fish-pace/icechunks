# OA indicators — what the build found

Built 2026-09-17 in PR #24. A **virtual** store at
`ocean-icechunks/oa-indicators/climatology`, snapshot `3VZQ6VDVY2644RZ9M0Z0`, from NCEI
accession 0270962. That accession ships one NetCDF per indicator; twelve are merged into one
flat group of 72 variables on `(depth 14, lat 76, lon 141)`. The whole store is **84 objects
and 35 kB** referencing 82 MB that stays at NCEI. No time dimension — it is a climatology,
and the accession is finished, so there is no update pipeline to write.

Merging one variable per file into a single store had no precedent here; CoastWatch splits
*into* groups because of codec differences, which is the opposite problem.

Further detail is in CLAUDE.md under "Key gotchas (OA indicators…)". The ones that cost time:

- **`xr.merge` applies `combine_attrs` to *variable* attributes, not just the dataset's.** So
  `combine_attrs="drop"` silently empties every variable's attrs. It looked like virtualizarr
  losing metadata and was not. Use `"drop_conflicts"` and clear the per-file globals by hand.
- **The source coordinates were unusable, not merely untidy.** Phony all-zero HDF5 dimension
  scales `dep`/`lat`/`lon`, with the real values in separate variables. xarray reports
  `Dimensions without coordinates`, so `sel(lat=...)` did not work on the source at all.
  `swap_dims` fixes it as metadata, which is all a virtual store can do.
- **CF compliance here was substantive.** `units` was `"N/A"` on every dimensionless field and
  `"degrees Celsius"` on temperature; `standard_name` held free text. Real CF standard names
  exist for only six of the twelve indicators — checked against the table, and **none
  invented** for saturation states, the Revelle factor, hydrogen ion content or carbonate per
  unit mass.
- **`vz.to_icechunk` defaults to `mode="w-"`**, so re-running a write raises
  `ContainsGroupError` rather than being a no-op. The notebook skips a populated store unless
  `OVERWRITE` is set. The same trap bit `ocean-heat-test-sc.ipynb`, fixed there with
  `mode="w"`.
- **NCEI sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`** where `coastwatch.noaa.gov` sends none.
  That, and nothing else, is why this viewer draws and the OHC one does not — see
  [viewers.md](viewers.md).

**Still unconfirmed:** whether the viewer actually *renders*. Transport is verified from here
(content types, `application/wasm`, CORS on both hosts); there is no browser on the hub, so
ask Eli. That division is the norm.
